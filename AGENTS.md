# minecraft-agent-skills

This repo is a skills bundle, not a Minecraft project. It ships 13 Minecraft
skills and a dual-target Codex/Claude Code plugin.

## Editing

- Treat `.agents/skills/` as canonical.
- After canonical changes, please  refresh `.codex/skills/`,
  `.claude/skills/`.
- Do not hand-edit mirrored skill trees.

## Skill standards

- Target Minecraft 1.21.x and Java 21 unless a section explicitly covers Forge
  1.20.1, which uses Java 17 and ForgeGradle 6.
- Keep platform-specific patterns clear and examples runnable.
- Keep JSON valid and formatted with 2-space indentation.
- Do not create cross-skill dependencies.

## Repository boundaries

- Do not run Minecraft, Gradle, or Paper server commands here.
- Keep helper scripts self-contained inside the skill that uses them.
- Do not add unstable Minecraft features or version guidance.
